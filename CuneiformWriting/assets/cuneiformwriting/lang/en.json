  "gamemechanicinfo-claytablets-text": "<strong>Clay Tablets</strong><br><i>Where's my copper ?</i><br><br>Writing on clay tablets is just like writing in books, except you'll be using near unreadable cuneiforms instead of letters. If that sounds fun to you, then here's how to do it.<br><br>First create a <a href=\"handbooksearch://cuneiformwriting and clay tablet\">clay tablet</a> using <a href=\"handbook://craftinginfo-clayforming\">clayforming</a>. Then, craft a <a href=\"handbooksearch://stylus\">stylus</a>. Put the tablet in your offhand and the stylus in your mainhand then <icon>rightmousebutton</icon> to edit the tablet.<br><br>In order to write, press either <icon>leftmousebutton</icon> for a standard stroke or <icon>rightmousebutton</icon> for a hook, then move the mouse to choose the orientation and length of the stroke. You can use Mousewheel up and down to set the width of the stroke. Once satisfied, pressing <icon>leftmousebutton</icon> will validate the stroke, while pressing <icon>rightmousebutton</icon> will cancel it. Quitting the edit screen will save the strokes to the tablet.<br><br>Any of the raw tablets can be fired either in a <a href=\"handbook://block-pitkiln\">pit kiln</a> or in a <a href=\"handbook://gamemechanicinfo-beehivekiln\">beehive kiln</a>, the latter offering more color choices.<br><br>The strokes are visible on the tablet in world, but if you need a better view, then simply putting the tablet in your mainhand and holding <icon>rightmousebutton</icon> while the offhand is empty will make you hold the tablet in front of your face for easier reading."
